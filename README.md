An opensource application to implement genetic algorithm for Hello World

## Features

+ Creation of population is randomized, you only need to specify the target string and the population size

+ Allowed characters for randomization are as follows:

```js
const lowercase = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';
const uppercase = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ';
const numeric = '0123456789';
const symbols = '~`!@#$%^&*()_+-={}[]:";\'<>?,./|\\ ';
```

+ Cost function utilized Levenshtein Distance to compute distance between strings

+ Crossover has one parent set to best parent possible and the other is set to a random crossover chance to pick the second best or a random one on the group, crossover chance is set to 0.5 by default

+ Crossover rate is set to random or a default value of 2 if a zero occurs, this rate is used to compute the pivot on where to split the strings for crossover

+ For computing mutation rate of crossover offsprings, the mutation rate of the parents are averaged, which is then added to a new random rate of the offspring which is also averaged right after to get a mutation rate of an offspring with respect to their parents mutation rate 

+ For the initial cost of the crossover offsprings, the cost of the parents are averaged 

+ Mutation chance is set to 0.5 by default, and mutates only if the chromosomes mutation rate is greater than the mutation chance

+ Mutation also utilizes the allowed characters for randomization
